Once upon a time there was a DOS user who saw Unix, and saw that it was
good.  After typing cp on his DOS machine at home, he downloaded GNU's
unix tools ported to DOS and installed them.  He rm'd, cp'd, and mv'd
happily for many days, and upon finding elvis, he vi'd and was happy.  After
a long day at work (on a Unix box) he came home, started editing a file,
and couldn't figure out why he couldn't suspend vi (w/ ctrl-z) to do
a compile.

Comparing software engineering to classical engineering assumes that software
has the ability to wear out.  Software typically behaves, or it does not.  It
either works, or it does not.  Software generally does not degrade, abrade,
stretch, twist, or ablate.  To treat it as a physical entity, therefore, is
misapplication of our engineering skills.  Classical engineering deals with
the characteristics of hardware; software engineering should deal with the
characteristics of *software*, and not with hardware or management.

For example, if \thinmskip = 3mu, this makes \thickmskip = 6mu.  But if
you also want to use \skip12 for horizontal glue, whether in math mode or
not, the amount of skipping will be in points (e.g., 6pt).  The rule is
that glue in math mode varies with the size only when it is an \mskip;
when moving between an mskip and ordinary skip, the conversion factor
1mu=1pt is always used.  The meaning of '\mskip\skip12' and
'\baselineskip=\the\thickmskip' should be clear.

Mr. Jones related an incident from "some time back" when IBM Canada
Ltd. of Markham, Ont., ordered some parts from a new supplier in Japan.  The
company noted in its order that acceptable quality allowed for 1.5 per cent
defects (a fairly high standard in North America at the time).
	The Japanese sent the order, with a few parts packaged separately in
plastic. The accompanying letter said: "We don't know why you want 1.5 per
cent defective parts, but for your convenience, we've packed them separately."

Real computer scientists admire ADA for its overwhelming aesthetic
value but they find it difficult to actually program in it, as it is
much too large to implement.  Most computer scientists don't notice
this because they are still arguing over what else to add to ADA.

Real computer scientists despise the idea of actual hardware.  Hardware has
limitations, software doesn't.  It's a real shame that Turing machines are
so poor at I/O.

Real computer scientists don't comment their code.  The identifiers are
so long they can't afford the disk space.
%
Real computer scientists don't program in assembler.  They don't write
in anything less portable than a number two pencil.

Real computer scientists don't write code.  They occasionally tinker with
`programming systems', but those are so high level that they hardly count

Real computer scientists only write specs for languages that might run

Real programmers don't bring brown-bag lunches.  If the vending machine

Real Programmers don't write in FORTRAN.  FORTRAN is for pipe stress freaks

Real programs don't eat cache.

Real Programs don't use shared text.  Otherwise, how can they use functions

Real software engineers don't debug programs, they verify correctness.
This process doesn't necessarily involve execution of anything on a
computer, except perhaps a Correctness Verification Aid package.
%
Real software engineers don't like the idea of some inexplicable and
greasy hardware several aisles away that may stop working at any
moment.  They have a great distrust of hardware people, and wish that

Windows 3.1 Beer: The world's most popular. Comes in a 16-oz. can that
looks a lot like Mac Beer's. Requires that you already own a DOS Beer.
Claims that it allows you to drink several DOS Beers simultaneously, but
in reality you can only drink a few of them, very slowly, especially
slowly if you are drinking the Windows Beer at the same time.  Sometimes,
for apparently no reason, a can of Windows Beer will explode when you
open it.
%
Windows 95 Beer: A lot of people have taste-tested it and claim it's
wonderful. The can looks a lot like Mac Beer's can, but tastes more like
Windows 3.1 Beer. It comes in 32-oz.  cans, but when you look inside, the
cans only have 16 oz. of beer in them. Most people will probably keep
drinking Windows 3.1 Beer until their friends try Windows 95 Beer and say
they like it. The ingredients list, when you look at the small print, has
some of the same ingredients that come in DOS beer, even though the
manufacturer claims that this is an entirely new brew.
%
Windows Airlines:
The terminal is very neat and clean, the attendants all very attractive, the
pilots very capable. The fleet of Learjets the carrier operates is immense.
Your jet takes off without a hitch, pushing above the clouds, and at 20,000
feet it explodes without warning.
%
Windows NT Beer: Comes in 32-oz. cans, but you can only buy it by the
truckload. This causes most people to have to go out and buy bigger
refrigerators. The can looks just like Windows 3.1 Beer's, but the
company promises to change the can to look just like Windows 95 Beer's --
after Windows 95 beer starts shipping. Touted as an "industrial strength"

Wings of OS/400:
The airline has bought ancient DC-3s, arguably the best and safest planes

though the drinks cost $15 a pop. Stupid questions cost $230 per hour,

The astronomical theme in the Unix crew began with Joe Ossanna's
"azel", which had controlled the Telstar ground station, and we used to
tell us where to find artificial satellites. Next came Bob Morris's
"sky" program, then Ken's celestial event predictor, Lee McMahon's star
maps made with my "map" program, and finally Rob's "scat" star catalog

Summary--What's most important
To put my strongest concerns in a nutshell:
1. We should have some ways of coupling programs like
garden hose--screw in another segment when it becomes
necessary to massage data in another way.

The genius of the Unix pipeline is precisely that it is constructed
from the very same commands used constantly in simplex fashion. The
mental leap needed to see this possibility and to invent the notation
is large indeed

It was really with v7 that the system fledged and left the research
nest. V7 was the first portable edition, the last common ancestor of a 
radiative explosion to countless varieties of hardware. Thus the
history of v7 is part of the common heritage of all Unix systems

Lex was rewritten almost immediately by Eric Schmidt as a summer
student. I had written it with a non-deterministic analyzer that
couldn't handle rules with more than 16 states. Al Aho was frustrated
and got me a summer student to fix it. He just happened to be unusual

I wrote Make over the weekend, and then rewrote it the next weekend
with macros (the list of built-in code was getting too long). I didn't
fix the tab-in-column-1 because I quickly had a devoted user base of
more than a dozen people and didn't want to upset them

You can't trust code that you did not totally create yourself.
(Especially code from companies that employ people like me).
No amount of source-level verification or scrutiny will protect you
from using untrusted code.

The Unix operating system presently is used at 1400 universities and
colleges around the world. It is the basis for 70 computer lines
covering the microcomputer to supercomputer spectrum: there are on the
order of 100,000 Unix systems now in operation, and approximately 100
companies are developing applications based on it

Dennis hooked me into the portability effort with one sentence:
"I think that it would be easier to move Unix to another piece of
hardware than to rewrite an application ro tun under a different
operating system". I was all in from that point on
