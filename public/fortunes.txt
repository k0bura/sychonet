Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh
rather than complicate old programs by adding new "features".

This is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one thing and do it
well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text
streams, because that is a universal interface.

The notion of "intricate and beautiful complexities" is almost an

The genius of the Unix pipeline is precisely that it is constructed
