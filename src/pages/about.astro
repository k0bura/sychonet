    <pre class="bio-header">▒▒▒ ORIGIN STORY ▒▒▒</pre>

    <p>Grew up staring into CRTs until the phosphors burned
    permanent ghosts into the glass. Fell in love with the dark
    art of making silicon do things it wasn't supposed to do.
    Not the kind of hacking that makes the news. The kind where
    you're elbow-deep in hex dumps at 3am whispering "why are
    you like this" to a UART that won't handshake.</p>

    <p>There's a beauty in watching software talk to hardware.
    No abstraction layers. No frameworks. Just voltage levels
    and timing diagrams and the raw satisfaction of an LED
    blinking because YOU told it to. Electrons obeying your
    will. That's the real magic.</p>

    <pre class="bio-header">▒▒▒ MISSION ▒▒▒</pre>

    <p>Restoring the passions from the golden age of creative
    engineering. Before the Pentium ruined everything by being
    too fast to appreciate. Back when laptops weighed 12kg and
    we called them "luggables" with a straight face. Back when
    a portable computer meant you only needed two people to
    carry it.</p>

    <p>This is the era of the 8-bit and 16-bit machines. The
    Z80, the 6502, the 8088. Machines you could understand
    completely. Machines that didn't phone home. Machines that
    booted in the time it takes a modern laptop to decide which
    update to force on you.</p>
