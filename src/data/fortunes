Unix was not only an improvement on its predecessors but also on most

The genius of the Unix pipeline is precisely that it is constructed

I had it written but I didn't put it in the central repository of
programs because I didn't want people to think that I dictated what was

next morning I showed him the program that I had written earlier.
