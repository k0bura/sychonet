## Retrobrighting the Keycaps

Keycaps were yellowed. Typical ABS plastic problem -- bromine flame retardant reacts with UV over the years, plastic turns yellow-brown.

### The Hydrogen Peroxide Method

Fix is hydrogen peroxide. I used **SalonCare 40 Volume Creme Developer** from Sally Beauty Supply. About 12% hydrogen peroxide in a thick cream that clings to plastic. Basically retrobright in a bottle.

#### What You Need

- SalonCare 40 Volume Creme Developer (16 oz bottle)
- A pot large enough to submerge the keycaps
- A thermometer
- Kitchen gloves -- the cream irritates skin
- Warm soapy water for cleanup

#### Process

I went with the heat method. Heat replaces UV as the catalyst. More even results since everything is submerged, and you don't need to wait for a sunny day.

1. **Remove all keycaps** from the keyboard.
2. **Fill a pot** with SalonCare 40 Volume Creme Developer and enough water to fully submerge the keycaps.
3. **Heat on the stove at low heat** -- use a thermometer and keep the temperature low. You want a gentle simmer, not a boil.
4. **Submerge the keycaps** and let them cook. Check periodically -- results are typically visible within 1-2 hours depending on the severity of yellowing.
5. **Remove and wash thoroughly** in warm soapy water and allow to air dry before reinstalling.

**TODO:** Add before/after photos.

## Keyboard Cable

Proprietary connector. Cable gets brittle with age and falls apart. Mine was damaged but still functional enough to tape up. Planning to custom coil a replacement at some point.

**TODO:** Add photo of the cable and connector.
