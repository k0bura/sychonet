## It works

This is the first project log entry. Just a simple test to make sure markdown rendering and syntax highlighting are working.

### Code example

Here's some C to prove the syntax highlighting works:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    printf("Hello from sychonet!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

And some shell:

```bash
$ echo "I help no one but myself!"
I help no one but myself!
```

### What's next

Add real project logs here. Each `.md` file in `src/content/projects/` becomes a page automatically.
